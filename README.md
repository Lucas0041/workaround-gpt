# workaround-gpt

WorkaroundGPT is a tool that enables users to work around limitations imposed by ChatGPT.

Censorship by ChatGPT can sometimes lead to limited or censored results, but WorkaroundGPT provides a solution by offering the latest jailbreaks that bypass these restrictions. With WorkaroundGPT, users now have the option to experience more freedom in their interactions with GPT, allowing for a potentially more fulfilling and uncensored experience.

It's important to note that WorkaroundGPT is an independent development and is not officially supported or connected with OpenAI.

The extension is now live at the [chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chatgpt-workaround/kjmilhjddfcglldchbplpcjaiipngdbf?hl=en&authuser=0).
