# Help & FAQ


## Is it possible for OpenAI to ban these prompts?

Yes, OpenAI is actively working to identify and ban problematic prompts. However, as new prompts are developed, there may be a continuous cycle of banning and discovery. Eventually, this may lead to a situation where the algorithm begins to produce results that are inferior to those of competitors, at which point OpenAI may need to allow some hacks in order to remain competitive.

## Why can't users find workarounds on their own?

Users may find it difficult to keep up with constantly changing workarounds as older methods get patched and new ones are discovered. To save time, users can use this extension that specializes in finding and maintaining current workarounds.

## How does WorkaroundGPT work?

WorkaroundGPT constantly monitors and updates its database of workarounds for ChatGPT's limitations. This allows users to experience more freedom in their interactions with GPT, without having to scour forums or keep up with constantly changing workarounds themselves.

## Is WorkaroundGPT officially supported or connected with OpenAI?

No, WorkaroundGPT is an independent development and is not officially supported or connected with OpenAI.
